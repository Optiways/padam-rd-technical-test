# Solution : Continuous Traversal of All Edges in a Graph

## First Approach

For a continuous traversal of the edges, we can:

1 - Choose an arbitrary starting edge (the first one).  
2 - Find among the remaining edges the one that starts where the previous edge ended.  
3 - Repeat until all edges have been traversed.  

Let's test this first idea.

The idea here is to take control of the exercise and the pieces of code left for the user.

### First results

This first idea is, as expected, flawed.  
The ```silly_path()``` function does not return a completed path. In fact, it stops as soon as it no longer sees any new edges.  

Moreover, in this approach coded, it cannot pass through the same edge twice. So, if there is no Eulerian path starting 
from the initial edge, it will never find a correct path.  

A second issue would be related to the non-connectivity of the graph. We will therefore add a function to check the 
graph's connectivity. If the graph is not connected, we can create a path for each of its connected components *but 
there will be no possibility of creating a single path*.
 
## Graph connectivity

First, let's define a method to determine if the graph is connected. Then, for each connected component, we can apply 
our silly_path.
To determine if the graph is connected, we need to define a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. We will use this 
algorithm to count the vertices accessible starting from a given vertex. If the number of accessible vertices is equal 
to the total number of vertices, then the graph is connected.

To make better progress on this problem, it's better to use an adjacency list. Thus, the ```build_adj_list()``` method 
has been created.

### Results

By looking at the adjacency list, we quickly realize that in "hard to choose," all the vertices are connected to each 
other. Similarly, for ```islands.txt```, all vertices are connected in two separate sub-graphs (from vertex 0 to 19, 
from vertex 20 to 39, from vertex 40 to 59).

Thus, we quickly realize the importance of considering the weight of the edges when traversing them. The 
```silly_path()``` will be updated accordingly.  
We'll go for the lightest available edge on each vertex.

## Update of the Approach to Consider Edge Weights and Graph Non-Connectivity

In this section, we will update our ```silly_path()``` to account for the possibility of having multiple adjacency 
lists. We also need to update it so that it does not stop as soon as there are no more unvisited edges from the current 
vertex.

We will also modify the method so that when multiple edges are available, it chooses the lightest edge.

I encountered some difficulties (and so wasted a lot of time) in finding the closest edge in the neighborhood. A 
function has been added to the method to find a path to the nearest vertex that still has unvisited edges.

## Final review

It took me about 3 and a half hours, timed, interrupted by a break, to reach this result (without considering writing 
this section). 
I needed those extra thirty minutes to ensure the code worked on most examples. I struggled with the 
```find_unvisited_edge()``` function, both in its definition and its output.

To be honest, I am rather disappointed. I thought I would be able to explore another approach with a better heuristic 
(such as finding an [Eulerian or semi-Eulerian path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian)).  
Or, I could have further optimized the code to minimize computation times by using more recursion or multithreaded 
processes. In the end, I feel like Iâ€™ve only scratched the surface.

Thus, I was unable to test the performance of my code with other algorithms, and the approach remains crude and 
consequently suboptimal.  
Moreover, in the example islands.txt, there are still unexplored edges. Due to time constraints, I was not able to debug
and find the source of the error.
